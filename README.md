# mw2dbm

Small command line program which takes one or more mw values and converts
them to dBm.  If there's more than one value it prints out all invididual
values and sum of all mw.

This is maybe my third go program ever.  Please be nice.

Usage:


```
mw2dbm % ./mw2dbm 1.619 0.928 0.024 0.023
mw 1.6190 db 2.0925
mw 0.9280 db -0.3245
mw 0.0240 db -16.1979
mw 0.0230 db -16.3827
mw sum 2.5940000000000003
dbm sum 4.139699717480613
```

Badly needs testing and all that.
